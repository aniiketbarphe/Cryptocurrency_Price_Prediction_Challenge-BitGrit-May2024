# Cryptocurrency_Price_Prediction_Challenge-BitGrit-May2024
Brief
Welcome to the Crypto Currency Price Prediction Challenge!

In the ever-evolving world of digital finance, cryptocurrencies have become much more than just an investment opportunity – they're revolutionizing the way we think about and engage in transactions online. After a rollercoaster year in 2022, marked by market downturns in response to interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, it's been nothing short of thrilling to see cryptos bounce back with vigor at the start of 2023, even close to hitting record highs without any easing of federal funds rates.

Amidst this exciting landscape, bitgrit – a leading company in data science competitions and an emerging force in Web3 technology – is thrilled to announce the upcoming release of its own token, BGR. This new token is set to enrich experiences on our platform, making our community and competitions even more engaging. Now is the best time to celebrate our new endeavor with a brand-new challenge that's all about forecasting the future of the crypto price. Whether you're a seasoned trader or simply crypto-curious, we're inviting you to put your prediction prowess to the test.

"Will the cryptocurrency (ticker is undisclosed) rise or fall within a two-week window?" That's for you to decide, using a rich tapestry of information ranging from market trends to social media indicators. We believe that diversity fuels innovation, so no matter where you come from or what your background is, if you've got a knack for numbers and a passion for crypto, join a warm community of like-minded enthusiasts and excel in a professional yet congenial competition atmosphere.

Data Breakdown
The goal of this competition is to predict whether the price of crypto currency will go up (1) or down (0) 2 weeks from the day of prediction, which is indicated by "Target" column by using the following information:

ID: ID of each data point.

Target: 0 - the price dropped 2 weeks after the time of prediction 1 - the price increased 2 weeks after the time of prediction.

feature_x_y: independent variables from the market data.

TR_x_EventInd: Event that may of may not affect the crypto currencies price.

index_1 ~ index_3: the search trend on specific keywords pretaining to crypto currencies.

Downloadable file "crypto_competition.zip" includes the following files:

train.csv: file to train your machine learning model.

test.csv: file that can be used to test how well your model performs on unseen data. This is the file you're going to make predictions on with your trained model and create a submission file.

solution_format.csv: example of the format that the submission file needs to be in to be properly scored.

*The submission file should follow the same format as the example file (solution_format.csv). The submission file has 2 columns, one for id and one for value.

**Submissions are evaluated by "F1 Score".

***Final competition results are based on the Private Leaderboard results, and the winner will be the user at the top of the Private Leaderboard.

4. It is not allowed to upload the competition dataset to other websites. Users who do not comply with this rule will be disqualified.

5. A competition prize will be awarded after we have received, successfully executed, and confirmed the validity of both the code and the solution (See 6.). Once winners are announced and our team reaches out to them, the winners must provide the following by June 10, 2024 to be qualified as a competition winner and receive their prize: a. All source files required to preprocess the data b. All source files required to build, train and make predictions with the model using the processed data c. A requirements.txt (or equivalent) file indicating all the required libraries and their versions as needed d. A ReadMe file containing the following: • Clear and unambiguous instructions on how to reproduce the predictions from start to finish including data pre-processing, feature extraction, model training, and predictions generation • Environment details regarding where the model was developed and trained, including OS, memory (RAM), disk space, CPU/GPU used, and any required environment configurations required to execute the code • Clear answers to the following questions: - Which data files are being used? - How are these files processed? - What is the algorithm used and what are its main hyperparameters? - Any other comments considered relevant to understanding and using the model

6. The submitted solution should be able to generate exactly the same output that gives the corresponding score on the leaderboard. If the score obtained from the code is different from what’s shown on the leaderboard, the new score will be used for the final rankings unless a logical explanation is provided. Please make sure to set the seed or random_state etc. so we can obtain the same result from your code.

7. The final submission has to be selected manually before the end of the competition (you can select up to 2), or else it will be selected automatically based on your highest public score.

8. In order to be eligible for the prize, the competition winner must agree to transfer to the Host and the relevant transferee of rights in such Competition all transferable rights, such as copyrights, rights to obtain patents and know-how, etc. in and to all analysis and prediction results, reports, analysis and prediction model, algorithm, source code and documentation for the model reproducibility, etc., and the Submissions contained in the Final Submissions.
